//to create a new rust project with cargo use carge new "project"
//to build a project use cargo build
//to run it use cargo run 
//cargo checks only checks if it compiles but does not create the executable, it is much
//faster
//use cargo build --release if you are 100% ready to release the program will have a faster run time
